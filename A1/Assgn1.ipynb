I had expected that my model should have less perplexity for the trigrams model but the result said otherwise. I could see the bigram perplexity was lower than the trigram, which was unexpected.\n",

    "**Answer:** When testing bigram models trained on the Brown and Webtext corpora on Reuters sentences, the Webtext model performed better, yielding a lower perplexity score on average. This indicates that Webtext's structure and vocabulary align more closely with Reuters' modern financial news style, whereas the Brown corpus contains older, more formal language that does not generalize as well.\n",
    "Comparing the performance results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Webtext contains more modern terms, making it more suited to Reuters’ language which in general led to overlapping vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial and news-related text structures align better with Webtext than Brown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Brown corpus includes legal, literary, and outdated news styles, which do not suit well to Reuters' financial news domain."

    "**Answer:** Increasing the number of sentences in the training data would improve next-word prediction by providing better probability estimates and reducing perplexity of the trigram and bigram models both. With more data, the model learns a wider range of word combinations, making predictions more accurate and reducing the chances of encountering unknown sequences. It will also help capture rare words and domain-specific terms, leading to a more balanced and natural output. "
